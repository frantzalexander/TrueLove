# TrueLove
True love is all in a name. ðŸ’“

## The Goal
Create a calculator that assess two full names and construct a compatibility score with a funny comment.ðŸ¤£  

## The Result
A calculator that outputs a compatibility score with a comment.

## The Process
Utilized Python programming language with variables, string interpolation, user input functions and conditional statements.

The input function was used to collect the user information and then placed into a variable for each name. 

The given user data was then combined into a single variable. This allowed for easier formatting adjustments. 

The string method "lower" was used to modify the string text into all lower case. The purpose was to create a simple way to count each letter. 

The string method "count" was applied to evaluate the number of occurances for each letter in the word "True Love" that appeared in the user full names.

Finally, conditional statements were arranged to associate the final score with a comment.
